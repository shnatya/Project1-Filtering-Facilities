This project gives an opportunity to show recreational centers located in the USA. Users can choose what type of centers they want to be listed on the screen. In the light-blue form there are five checkboxes: Campground, Activity Pass, Facility, Visitor Centor, Ticket Facility. Below the checkboxes, three buttons are located : 
- **Select All** to select all checkboxes at once;

- **Clear All** to uncheck all checkboxes and clear the table. 

The table has four columns:

- **Phone** 
- **Like** Users can check facilities which they like or uncheck them using **Like** button presenting  in each row.
