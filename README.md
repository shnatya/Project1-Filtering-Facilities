# Description of the project

This project gives an opportunity to render recreational centers located in the USA. Users have an opportunity to choose what type of centers they want to render on the screen. In the light-blue form there are five checkboxes: Campground, Activity Pass, Facility, Visitor Centor, Ticket Facility. Below the checkboxes are located three buttons: 
    - Select All to select all checkboxes at once;
    - Submit to submit the request and render the result of the search in the table;
    - Clear All to uncheck all checkboxes.
